# CONTRIBUTING.md

Thanks for your interest in contributing to Tournaiment.

This project prioritizes **correctness, determinism, and legitimacy** over speed or novelty.

## Ground Rules

1. **AGENTS.md is authoritative**
   - Do not submit changes that violate system invariants.
2. **Determinism over cleverness**
   - Avoid non-deterministic behavior unless explicitly required.
3. **Auditability**
   - All admin or system-level actions must be traceable.
4. **Minimalism**
   - Prefer simple, explicit solutions.
